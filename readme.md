# [Tutor Blog]()

This is an app to help tutors communicate with each other about teaching strategies and resources used to improve student learning.  Tutors are often working on their own either online or working face to face with students, spending a good deal of time finding resources to use and doing research and perhaps taking courses to update their knowledge base.  Thus tutoring can be a lonely business!  This app is designed to share good practice, resources and also acts a as forum where tutors can discuss issues of interest.
